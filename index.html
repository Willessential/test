                    <p class="lead">In our role as an Electrical Distribution company, we oversee the vast network of powerlines across the state. We serve as the main hub that enables residences and businesses to exchange electricity, facilitating not just the distribution, but also the exchange of energy. However, in this complex and ever-evolving landscape, there are challenges that could affect our operations and the safety of our staff. One such issue is the phenomenon known as backfeed.</p>

                    <h3>Overview of Backfeed</h3>
<p>Backfeed refers to a situation where electricity, instead of following its usual path from the power station to the customer, reverses its direction. This can occur when an electrical generator such as solar panels or a diesel generator is not wired correctly, feeding power back into the electrical grid.</p>
<h3>Risks Associated with Backfeed</h3>
<p>Backfeed can prove hazardous for our employees. If the backfeed incident occurs while they are working on the power lines, the lines can become unexpectedly energised. Despite adhering to deenergisation procedures, our linesmen may be unwittingly exposed to these energised lines, facing possible electrocution or other related injuries.</p>

                    <h3>Navigating through the Latest Generation Technologies</h3>
<p>As residential and commercial sectors increasingly adopt advanced electrical generation technologies such as solar panels and diesel generators, the risk of backfeed increases. These technologies, when improperly installed or mismanaged, can become sources of backfeed accidents.</p>
<h3>Spotting Potential Backfeed Issues</h3>
<p>It is crucial that our teams are trained to recognise potential backfeed issues. Looking out for signs such as persisting voltage on the lines, even after disconnection, can provide early warnings of a potential backfeed situation.</p>

                    <h3>Getting Started: Navigating the 3D Model</h3>
<p>In this section, we will use a 3D model to simulate an electrical network that experienced backfeed. Using an immersive, interactive, and user-friendly visual guide will help in understanding what backfeed looks like and how it affects the network.</p>
<h3>Observing Potential Backfeed Sources</h3>
<p>As you move around the 3D environment, you will be directed towards potential backfeed sources. Understanding their common locations and the related equipment implicated in backfeed events is a crucial step in ensuring occupational safety.</p>
<h3>Investigative Techniques to Identify Backfeed Risks</h3>
<p>In a true 'Sherlock Holmes' style, you'll evaluate different clues and signals that can indicate a backfeed situation. This interactive exploration is all about being proactive and alert for possible electrical risks.</p>

                    <h3>Understanding the Safety Rules</h3>
<p>The Australian Electrical Safety Rules provide the guidance necessary to avoid electrical hazards, including backfeed, when correctly adhered to. It's not just about knowing these rules but deeply understanding them and their application in real-life scenarios.</p>
<h3>Application of the Rules in Mitigating Backfeed</h3>
<p>You'll learn how to apply these rules in different situations, giving you the tools you need to stay safe and ensure electrical systems operate as they should, without causing backfed power that can endanger lives.</p>

                    <h3>Mitigation Simulation</h3>
<p>Now it's your turn to implement what you've learned. In this simulation, you'll be presented with a scenario involving potential backfeed. Using your knowledge, decide on the correct mitigation procedures according to the Australian Electrical Safety Rules.</p>
<h3>When in Doubt – Calling in for Help</h3>
<p>If at any point during the process you are confused or unsure, ask for assistance from more experienced colleagues or from a supervisor. It’s important to remember that every action, no matter how small, can have significant effects on your safety and the safety of those around you.</p>
